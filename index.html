    <h1>today</h1>
    <h2>today i learned - 1 avril 2022</h2>
    <p>I recall that simple recall is an effective technique of learning. Closing ones eye and remembering the things that come to one's mind. I recall reading the code and design weeklies in my mailbox. The A11yphant challenges that I did today for learning accessibility, and from those I learned about the DOCTYPE tag and that the html attribute let's the browser know that the document is the latest HTML5.</p>
    <p>The title of the page is enclosed in the <code>title</code> tag inside the <code>head</code> element. It can be the same as the <code>h1</code> heading of the document. There should be only one <code>h1</code> heading and it has to be the first element before all the other headings except when another heading best describes the page content.</p>
    <p>I am practicing the drop two voicings of the major7, minor7, dominant7, diminished and half-diminished chords and was happy today because I made some progress.</p>

    <p>This photo inspires me. In the Artist's Way there is a task to collect images of a future or dream that we would like to create.</p>
    <p>Yesterday I drew this drawing after <a href="https://hu.pinterest.com/pin/6544361949919820/">Miroco Machiko's drawing of a cat</a>. It felt great.</p>
